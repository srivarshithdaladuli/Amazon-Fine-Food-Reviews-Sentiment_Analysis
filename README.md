# Amazon Fine Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is focused on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a review is positive or negative based on the text content.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which can be obtained from the following link: [Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

The dataset consists of reviews for various food products available on Amazon, along with corresponding ratings and textual reviews. The data has been preprocessed to remove any personal information.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

```
|-- data/
|   |-- Reviews.csv

```

- **data**: Contains the dataset file `Reviews.csv`.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project, such as data exploration, data preprocessing, and building the sentiment analysis model.
- **src**: Python source code for data loading, data preprocessing, and the sentiment analysis model.
- **models**: The trained sentiment analysis model stored as `sentiment_model.pkl`.
- **README.md**: The readme file you are currently reading.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of required Python libraries and their versions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-fine-food-reviews-sentiment-analysis.git
cd amazon-fine-food-reviews-sentiment-analysis
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the `data` folder.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and explore the project notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the project workflow.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building the sentiment analysis model, the textual data needs to be preprocessed. This involves steps such as removing stop words, tokenization, and stemming or lemmatization. The `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory demonstrates this process.

## Sentiment Analysis Model

The sentiment analysis model is built using machine learning techniques to predict whether a review is positive or negative. The `Sentiment_Analysis_Model.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory contains the model building process.

## Using the Trained Model

Once the model is trained, you can use it to perform sentiment analysis on new textual data. The trained model is stored in `models/sentiment_model.pkl`. An example of how to use the model is provided in the `Sentiment_Analysis_Model.ipynb` notebook.
